# Welcome to the `pot` documentation

Welcome! This is the documention of `pot`, an opensource jail framework/manager for FreeBSD.
It's designed to support multiple jail usage, from VM emulation to small container model.

A good place to start, is the [Getting started guide](Getting.md) or the [Installation Guide](Installation.md).  
`pot` can be used to manage [Thin jails](Thin.md), [Thick jails](Thick.md) or [Containers](Container.md).  
There are also detailed sections about [Network conifguration](Network.md) and [Pot images](Images.md).


Soon, you'll find additional sections about `potMachine`, to allow you to use `pot` on different operating systems, and `minipot`, a one-node based service mesh that allow you to play with `nomad`
